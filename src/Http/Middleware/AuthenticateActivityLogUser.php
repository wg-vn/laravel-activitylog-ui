/**
 * Ensures the request is authenticated, without assuming which guard.
 *
 * This used to be decided when routes were registered, by inspecting the
 * configured stack for something that looked like authentication and appending
 * a plain 'auth' when it found none. That inspection could not be made
 * reliable: middleware groups and aliases are registered on the router by the
 * HTTP kernel, and `route:cache` boots through the console kernel instead, so
 * the same configuration produced one stack at request time and a different one
 * baked into the cached routes.
 *
 * Asking at request time removes the guessing. Laravel's Authenticate calls
 * shouldUse() on success, so a host stack that authenticated under any guard —
 * 'auth:admin', a group containing it, an alias for its own subclass — leaves a
 * user on the request, and this passes straight through.
